This year, two elite international cyclists, Jason English and Corey Wallace are all set to compete for the top prize. They are both multiple time MTB champions at a global stage.
                             Not only winning but completing this race is itself a very big achievement”, says Rohit Sharma, MTB National Elite commissure (CFI)
                            In addition to the aforementioned, an initiative branded “Trailblazers” has been introduced, a 25km race for the children of the region, which validates the premise of the event: to develop the sport of mountain biking at the grassroots level by providing a platform for talented riders. The winners get the opportunity to train at the UCI WCC satellite facility in New Delhi, furthering their chances of turning into professional cyclists.<img src="C:\Training\Week1\Assignments\Cycle Tracks\cycleTrack_left_image.jpg" style="float:left;border:solid 1px black;margin-top: 5px;margin-right: 5px;">
                            “l am thoroughly excited to be associated with the North Quest Challenge. Cycling across the picturesque enigma that is Ladakh, along with a host of talented riders is certain to be a truly unique experience”, said actor Rajkummar Rao, an ambassador for the event. “This is my ancestral land. I have grown up here and my business and life is here. And when it was time to give back to my homeland there is nothing better than promoting tourism, eco friendly travel and scouting and developing the best home-grown talent. Hence I started North Quest Challenge and haven’t looked back since. It will only get bigger and we are taking it international in the next few editions,”says Stany Wangchuk founder and promoter of North Quest Challenge and wisdom Eventosports.
                            Speaking about the event, organiser Harkirat Singh of Wisdom Event and sports said that there are few sports that can provide the level of euphoria that Mountain Biking can evoke.
